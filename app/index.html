	<p>We’re looking for an intern/graduate with a good head on their shoulders.</p>
	<p>You should be excited by all things design, code and ping pong. If you have experience with front-end code or programming that would be an advantage.</p>
	<p>We try to build an open and friendly culture where aside from delivering client work there’s a strong emphasis on group learning and personal development.</p>
	<p>Sounds like your bag? Get in touch with a link to your portfolio or a pdf to <a href="mailto:work@bypost.io?subject=Internship!">work@bypost.io</a></p>
